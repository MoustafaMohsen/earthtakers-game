## ➡️Inspiration inspiration 🧡

We found that NFT games always require some technical knowledge of how the blockchain works, NFT games are almost never beginner friendly thus always compete for the same potential pool of gamers, we want the game to be as easy for the moms as for the NFT gamers, the key is simple mechanics


## ➡️How to play

Playing is simple, you get started with 3 pets 🐹, with RGN ability and strength


## ➡️Gameplay 🎮

There are 4 main stages in the pets growth

**Pet**
You get started with a pet, they are junior 👶 creatures with limited strength and abilities , they gains experience from fighting and feeding, each time you feed or gain experience for your pet there is a small probability to level up, it’s not progressive it depends on chance, this applies for all stages

**Monster 👽**
Once your pet reaches a certain level it becomes a monster and is more stronger than a pet, although leveling up from this stage is hard, if keep leveling up your monsters eventually it becomes a Beast 

**Beast 👾**
Beasts are magnificent creatures but very hard to obtain, they are the strongest in the game and the hardest in fights, they require skill to play with

**Dead ☠**
After a certain amount of losing battles or if you forgot to feed you monster, it becomes DEAD, the more you monster grows the more power it have and the more feeding it needs



## ➡️Fighting style 🤼‍♂️
Similar to many RPG games but with less emphasis on powers and abilities and more on maneuverability, skill, and strategy

Currently the game in early stages, check the roadmap for more info

## ➡️Why build this game ❓

The goal for the game is to attract potential players who never used any blockchain based game to play EarthTakers and with an easy play-to-earn model that motivates first timers to try this game
